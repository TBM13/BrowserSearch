# BrowserSearch
This is a plugin for PowerToys Run.
It reads your default browser's history, allowing you to search its entries and open their URL.

## Supported browsers
* Arc
* Brave
* Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge (Chromium version)
* Naver Whale
* Opera
* Opera GX (profile selection not supported)
* Thorium
* Vivaldi Browser
* Waterfox
* Wavebox
* Zen Browser

Support for any other browser based on Chromium or Firefox can be added easily. If yours is not listed here, open an issue.

**NOTE**: Some browsers share the same ID. For example, if you have both Opera and Opera Developer installed, only the history of Opera will be loaded no matter which one of them is set as the default browser since we can't differentiate them by their ID.
